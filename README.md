# Tonic Docker Compose
Deploying Tonic via `docker-compose` is a relatively straightforward process. This repository contains an example/template docker-compose.yaml which can be used for this.

Project structure:
```
.
├── .template.env
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── README.md
```

[_docker-compose.yaml_](docker-compose.yaml)
``` yaml
services:
    tonic_web_server:
        image: quay.io/tonicai/tonic_web_server:latest
        ...
    tonic_worker:
        image: quay.io/tonicai/tonic_worker:latest
        ...
    tonic_pii_detection:
        image: quay.io/tonicai/tonic_pii_detection:latest
        ...
    # OPTIONAL (Recommended): This container must be deployed to support Webhooks and Email notifications.
    tonic_notifications:
        image: quay.io/tonicai/tonic_notifications:latest
        ...
    # OPTIONAL (Recommended): This container must be deployed to use the Smart Linking generator.
    tonic_pyml_service:
        image: quay.io/tonicai/tonic_pyml_service:latest
        ...
    # OPTIONAL: It is recommended to use a standalone or managed Postgres database
    # (e.g. AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) for Tonic's application database.
    # These provide many benefits such as automated backups and patches/upgrades. But a containerized PostgreSQL database can be used.
    tonic_db:
        image: postgres:14
        ...
```

## Configuration

### .env
Before deploying this setup, you need to rename [.template.env](.template.env) to `.env` and configure the following values, or set the environment variables directly within docker-compose.yaml. Note that several variables are shared by multiple, or all, containers.

### Tonic License

- This value will be provided by Tonic and must be input upon first startup of Tonic. Subsequently, it can be updated [from within the Tonic Admin portal](https://docs.tonic.ai/app/admin/on-premise-deployment/license-key-enter-update). Note that this was previously maintained via the `TONIC_LICENSE` environment variable, but this variable is no longer needed since version 519.

### Environment Name

- `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: E.g. "my-company-name", or if deploying multiple Tonic instances, "my-company-name-dev" or "my-company-name-prod to differentiate instances.

### Version

- `VERSION_TAG`: "latest" or a specific version tag. Tonic's tag convention is just the release number, e.g. "123". Release notes are available at [doc.tonic.ai](https://docs.tonic.ai/app/release-notes).

### Tonic Administrators

- `TONIC_ADMINISTRATORS`: Optional. See: https://docs.tonic.ai/app/the-tonic-platform/admin-users

### Application Database
The connection details for the Postgres metadata/application database which holds Tonic's state (user accounts, workspaces, etc.).

- `TONIC_DB_HOST`
- `TONIC_DB_PORT`
- `TONIC_DB_DATABASE`
- `TONIC_DB_USERNAME`
- `TONIC_DB_PASSWORD`

### One-Click Update and Host Integration
Tonic support One-Click Updates and other Host Integration features for Docker Compose.  To enable these features, you will need to uncomment the relevant container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.  You will also need to provide values in your `.env` file or if creating a new `.env` file, then uncomment the relevant section from `.template.env`.  The values that are needed are:

- `TONIC_HOST_INTEGRATION`
  - This value should be left as "DockerCompose"
- `TONIC_HOST_INTEGRATION_ACL`
  - If you rename or other change the container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, you will need to change this setting accordingly.  Otherwise it should be left as "http://tonic_docker_acl".
- `DOCKER_REPO_USERNAME`
  - The user account name for your Quay.io login.
  - This is needed to allow this feature to download updated images from Quay.
- `DOCKER_REPO_PASSWORD`
  - The user account key/password for your Quay.io login.
  - This is needed to allow this feature to download updated images from Quay.

### Log Collection
Tonic never collects your sensitive data. Enabling this option securely and safely shares logs with Tonic's engineering team. We recommend that you enable this option. See: https://docs.tonic.ai/app/sharing-logs-with-tonic

- `ENABLE_LOG_COLLECTION`: "false" (default) or "true"

### Consistency Seed
This value is used to support [Consistency](https://docs.tonic.ai/app/concepts/consistency) functionality across data generations.

- `TONIC_STATISTICS_SEED`: Any signed 32-bit integer, i.e. between -2147483648 and 2147483647

### Ports
The Tonic UI is accessible by default on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). These can be changed if you prefer or need to use different ports.

``` yaml
                ports:
                        - 80:80
                        - 443:443
```

### Memory Limits
The example docker-compose.yaml file includes memory limits per container. These are a baseline recommendation assuming a host with 16gb of memory dedicated to Tonic. In some cases it may be necessary to modify these limits and increase the total memory to more than 16gb.

### GPU support for PyML
The PyML container is used to support the [AI Synthesizer](https://docs.tonic.ai/app/generation/generators/ai-synthesizer) generator and Djinn. The docker-compose.yaml file contains additional optional configuration options to enable Nvidia GPU support for PyML.
In order for these settings to take effect, you must follow [these steps from the Docker documentation page](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu).
In particular,
- Nvidia drivers must be installed on the host machine. This can be verified by running `nvidia-smi` in a terminal.
- The nvidia-container-runtime must be installed. This can be verfiied by running `which nvidia-container-runtime-hook` in a terminal.

Additionally, uncomment the `deploy` section of the docker-compose.yaml file for the tonic_pyml_service container.

## Deploy
To run Tonic, execute the `docker-compose up -d` command from within the directory containing your docker-compose.yaml file.

``` shell
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating tonic_worker        ... done
Creating tonic_pii_detection ... done
Creating tonic_pyml_service  ... done
Creating tonic_notifications ... done
Creating tonic_web_server    ... done
```


## Validate the deployment

Use `docker ps` to check that containers are running:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                           COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                                         NAMES

```

The Tonic UI will be accessible in your browser on port 80 or 443. I.e. from the server at https://localhost:443 or http://localhost, or via the server IP/hostname or domain you are routing to the server.

Tonic may take a few minutes to fully startup. You can validate that it has fully started up and is in a healthy state by running `docker logs tonic_web_server | grep listening` and checking for the following output.

``` shell
$ docker logs tonic_web_server | grep listening
[2022-02-08T16:23:15+00:00 INF Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime] Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:80
[2022-02-08T16:23:15+00:00 INF Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime] Now listening on: https://0.0.0.0:443
```

### If the Tonic UI does not load
1. Check that Tonic is successfully connecting to the application database.
Run `docker logs tonic_web_server | grep "Failed to connect"`. If you see a `Failed to connect to db during startup.  Retrying in 5 seconds...` message like below, Tonic is not able to connect to your Postgres application database. Please verify the network path between Tonic and the database as well as the connection parameters.

``` shell
$ docker logs tonic_web_server | grep "Failed to connect"
[2022-02-08T16:18:26+00:00 WRN ] Failed to connect to db during startup.  Retrying in 5 seconds...
[2022-02-08T16:18:31+00:00 WRN ] Failed to connect to db during startup.  Retrying in 5 seconds...
[2022-02-08T16:18:36+00:00 WRN ] Failed to connect to db during startup.  Retrying in 5 seconds...
[2022-02-08T16:18:41+00:00 WRN ] Failed to connect to db during startup.  Retrying in 5 seconds...
```

2. If Tonic appears to be running and in a healthy state but you are unable to load the UI, verify that Tonic is reachable. Common issues may be a requirement to be on a VPN or firewall rules preventing access.
